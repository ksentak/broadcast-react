# Broadcast React

A personal portfolio site built with Gatsby and Typescript.

### To run the application:

Use `gatsby develop` to run the application locally. Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

### To build the application:

Use `gatsby build` to build the application into a production bundle. `gatsby build` creates a version of your site with production-ready optimizations like packaging up your siteâ€™s config, data, and code, and creating all the static HTML pages that eventually get rehydrated into a React application. Once this command is ran, your production-ready code will be available inside of the public folder.
